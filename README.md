## Set-up

To ensure the game runs smoothly, please follow the configuration steps below:

### 1. Config
Filepath: logic/score_db_connection/config.py

Add your database username and password into the appropriate fields in order to connect to the database.

### 2. SQL script
Filepath: logic/score_db_connection/dogtective_scores_db.sql

Run the `dogtective_scores_db.sql` script _(i.e. in SQLWorkbench or similar programme)_ to create the database.

### 3. Requirements/Dependencies
Please refer to `requirements.txt` for all dependencies that need to be installed for the game to run successfully.

**Note**: If you experience issues connecting to the database, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Conflicts may occur if both mysql-connector and mysql-connector-python packages are installed.
  - It may be advisable to check only mysql-connector-python is installed for this project


- Should you encounter further issues, please try uninstalling and reinstalling mysql-connector-python:
```
pip uninstall mysql-connector-python
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### 4. Run

Run the `game-runner` python file to start the game. Dogtective needs your help! ðŸ˜„
