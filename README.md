To ensure the game runs smoothly, please follow the configuration steps below:

### 1. Config
Filepath: logic/score_db_connection/config.py

Add your database username and password into the appropriate fields in order to connect to the database.

### 2. SQL script
Filepath: logic/score_db_connection/dogtective_scores_db.sql

Run the `dogtective_scores_db.sql` script _(i.e. in SQLWorkbench or similar programme)_ to create the database
