# Dogtective

The main character, a determined dog detective, is on a mission to recover a lost toy.
The toy has gone missing and Dogtective must dodge the moving cars to find it!

## Gameplay Mechanics:

### Navigation

Use mouse clicks for main menu and end screen navigation.

### Movement

Control Dogtective movements using the keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left and right).

### Health

Dogtective starts the game with five health bones in the top-left corner of the screen.

Colliding with vehicles reduces Dogtective's health _(bone count)_ with the amount lost depending on vehicle type:

- ![blue_car.png](logic/assets/images/obstacles/blue_car.png) &nbsp; 1 bone damage
- ![sport_yellow.png](logic/assets/images/obstacles/sport_yellow.png) &nbsp; 1 bone damage
- ![red_car.png](logic/assets/images/obstacles/red_car.png) &nbsp; 1 bone damage
- ![compact_orange.png](logic/assets/images/obstacles/compact_orange.png) &nbsp; 2 bone damage
- ![green_car.png](logic/assets/images/obstacles/green_car.png) &nbsp; 2 bone damage
- ![truck_red.png](logic/assets/images/obstacles/truck_red.png) &nbsp; 4 bone damage

### Timer

The game uses a background timer to calculate how much time the player has taken to complete the game, which is used to
calculate the score below.

### Scoring

**Health Bonus:**
Earn **1000 points** for each health bone left at the end of the game.

**Time Bonus:**
Finish in under 30 seconds for extra points. The player receives **10** points for every second left.

**Examples:**

- Finish with 4 bones in 15 seconds -> 4000 + 150 = **4150** points
- Finish with 5 bones in 30 seconds -> 5000 + 0 = **5000** points

## Set-up

To ensure the game runs smoothly, please follow the configuration steps below:

### 1. Config

Within your IDE, go to `logic/score_db_connection/config.py`.

Add your database username and password into the appropriate fields in order to connect to the database.

### 2. SQL script

Within your IDE, go to `logic/score_db_connection/dogtective_scores_db.sql`.

Run the `dogtective_scores_db.sql` script _(i.e. in SQLWorkbench or similar programme)_ to create the database.

### 3. Requirements/Dependencies

Please refer to `requirements.txt` for all dependencies that need to be installed for the game to run successfully.

**Note**: If you experience issues connecting to the database, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Conflicts may occur if both mysql-connector and mysql-connector-python packages are installed.
    - It may be advisable to check only mysql-connector-python is installed for this project


- Should you encounter further issues, please try uninstalling and reinstalling mysql-connector-python:

```
pip uninstall mysql-connector-python
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### 4. Run

Run the `game-runner` python file to start the game. Dogtective needs your help! ðŸ˜„
